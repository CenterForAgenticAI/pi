# Slices

Each slice is small enough for the owner to review in one sitting. Its brief says what it builds and what to know;
before it is built, the brief is filled out in detail, starting with p2's features in its area (`../workflow.md`).

| # | Slice | Brief | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Base and sessions | `01-base-and-sessions.md` | built, reviewed twice, waiting for the owner |

| 21 | Remote access, forwards and backups | `21-remote.md` | brief |
| 22 | Discord, chat mode and voice | `22-channels.md` | brief |
| 16 | Web and terminal | `16-ui.md` | waiting for the team's Elanor port |
| 4 | Admission (Chord) | `04-admission.md` | designed |
| 5 | People and apps | `05-people-and-apps.md` | designed in part |
| 6 | Locks | `06-locks.md` | designed |
| 17 | Org | `17-org.md` | later |

Rows are in build order (the numbers are ids): p2's features first, then what p3 adds (decision "Implement and
iterate, fundamentals first"). Each slice is small; where Chord makes a feature awkward, Chord is fixed in that slice. The
order may change as we learn; a reordering is a decision recorded in `../decisions.md`. Chord changes p3 needs
(lists and rows by key, pending Fable's study `chord-for-p3-fable.md` on slayer) get slices of their own when decided.

## p2's features by slice

The domains of p2's functionality map (`apps/p2/docs/p3-functions/README.md`) and p2's plugins, and the slice that
builds each in p3. A slice's details list every feature of its rows.
